'''
Write a python program to split the data â€™Xâ€™ into test and train dataset
and print them, use 70-30 split criteria.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Step 1: Define or generate the dataset 'X'
# For demonstration, we'll use a list of numbers as the dataset.
X = list(range(1, 101))  # Dataset with 100 numbers

# Step 2: Split the dataset into training and testing sets
train, test = train_test_split(X, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Step 3: Print the training and testing sets

    Import the train_test_split function:
        from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split: Imports the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection.

    Define the dataset X:
        X = list(range(1, 101)): Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 100.

    Split the dataset:
        train, test = train_test_split(X, test_size=0.3, random_state=42):
            X is the dataset to be split.
            test_size=0.3 specifies that 30% of the data should be in the test set.
            random_state=42 ensures reproducibility of the split.

    Print the training and testing sets:
        print("Training set:", train): Prints the training set.
        print("Testing set:", test): Prints the testing set.
